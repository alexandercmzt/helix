This was a project that wasn't able to reach total completion. This was a bioinformatics challenge and the given python program was used to use large amounts of data on previous patients to predict the health outcome of other patients. We tried both a machine learning approach and a trivial "finding similar patients" approach and ended up going with the latter due to both time contraints and that both gave reliable results. Unfortunately as this was a competition, we do not have the data use in the evaluation so this won't be able to run on it's own, but you can check out the code if you wish.
